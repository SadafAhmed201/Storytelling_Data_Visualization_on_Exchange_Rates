"Uncover the narrative behind global currencies with Storytelling Data Visualization on Exchange Rates. From 1999 to 2023, explore the financial journey through compelling visuals. üìäüíπ #DataViz #Finance"

# üìä Excited to share my latest project: "Storytelling Data Visualization on Exchange Rates 1999 to 2023" üåêüí±

Throughout the Project, we focused on explanatory data visualization and learned the following:

How to use information design principles (familiarity and maximizing the data-ink ratio) to create better graphs for an audience.
About the elements of a story and how to create storytelling data visualizations using Matplotlib.
How to guide the audience's attention with pre-attentive attributes.
How to use Matplotlib built-in styles ‚Äî with a case study on the FiveThirtyEight style.
How to make User-Friendly and an interactive line chart by using Plotly Express where we can see the value of the exchange rate and date while hovering over a line.

#Key Learnings

Throughout the project, I refined my skills in utilizing information design principles, maximizing the data-ink ratio, and creating visually appealing graphs tailored for diverse audiences. Unpacking the elements of a story played a pivotal role in shaping storytelling data visualizations, utilizing both Matplotlib and Seaborn as my artistic tools.

**Matplotlib Magic:**
Explored the intricacies of Matplotlib, focusing on pre-attentive attributes to guide the audience's attention. The project featured a captivating case study on the FiveThirtyEight style, delving into the nuanced world of this influential visualization style.

**Seaborn Elegance:**
Not to be overlooked, I embraced the elegance of Seaborn, further enhancing my visual storytelling toolkit. Seaborn's aesthetic appeal and simplicity complemented the project's goal of creating engaging and informative visualizations.

**Interactive Line Charts with Plotly Express:**
The project also showcased the creation of user-friendly and interactive line charts using Plotly Express. This not only allowed for presenting exchange rate values but also empowered viewers to explore specific data points by hovering over the lines.
